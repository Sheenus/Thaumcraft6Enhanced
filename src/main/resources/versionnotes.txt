Thaumcraft 6 Enhanced Version Notes

1.0.0
- Initial release
- Changed runic from using the absorption mechanic to using it's own unique mechanics:
	- damage mitigation on runic only affected by the player's armor rating (not toughness or enchanted protection)
		- damage to runic shielding *is* affected by the resistance magic effect
	- displays in a similar manner to TC4 runic shielding
	- damage to players while their runic shielding is charged will not damage their worn armor
	- runic shielding will not work for the following damage types:
		- withering
		- drowning
		- suffocating (stuck in blocks)
		- falling out of the world
		- getting crammed (too many entities within the one block)
		- starvation
	- runic shielding will not recharge instantly on damage, and will use the 'shieldwait' variable in the mod configuration menu
	- runic shielding will take double the time set by 'shieldwait' to recharge once reduced to 0
		- the wording of the display for the mod configuration has been changed to reflect this
	- players shot with arrows when runic shielding is charged will not have arrows left stuck in their player character
